# Alumni Portal — Prototype

This is a drop-in prototype built with React + Vite + Tailwindcss.
It includes role-based login (Student | Alumni | Admin) and the features you requested:
- AI Digital Twin (student-facing demo)
- Alumni Legacy Timeline
- Memory Capsules
- Alumni–Startup Collaboration Hub
- Predictive Career Guidance
- Social Impact (alumni-only)
- Admin panel (mock)

## Quick start

1. Install Node.js (v18+ recommended)
2. In the project folder, run:
   ```bash
   npm install
   npm run dev
   ```
3. Open the dev URL shown by Vite (usually http://localhost:5173)

This is a frontend-only prototype with mock data stored in browser localStorage.
For production, add a backend (Node/Express + DB) and secure authentication.
